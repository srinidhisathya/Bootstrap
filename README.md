# Bootstrap
This repository is of the course that I did on Coursera. <br /> 
"Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools: Bootstrap 4" provided by "The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology". <br />
In this project HTML, CSS, JavaScript is used with npm modules. <br />

To run this project: <br />
type "npm start" in the command window.

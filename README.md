# Bootstrap
This repository is of the course that I did on Coursera. "Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools: Bootstrap 4" provided by "The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology". In this project HTML, CSS, JavaScript is used with npm modules.  To run this project: type "npm start" in the command window.
